#Write a algorithm that uses iteration to allow Taylor to:
#• enter 10 values
#• count how many values are over 50
#• output the count of values over 50 after all 10 values are entered

#count=0
#for i in range(10):
    #num=int(input("Enter a number: "))
    #if num>50:
        #count+=1
#print(count)

#Taylor is writing an algorithm to record the results of an experiment.
#Taylor needs to be able to enter a numeric value which is added to a total which initially starts at 0.
#Every time she enters a value, the total is output.
#The algorithm repeats until the total is over 100.
# (a) Write an algorithm to implement Taylor’s requirements.
