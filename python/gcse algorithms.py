#The teacher writes a program to add up and print out the total number of minutes student 2 played
#computer games over 5 days (Monday to Friday).
 #total = 0
 #total = total + minsPlayed[2,0]
 #total = total + minsPlayed[2,1]
 #total = total + minsPlayed[2,2]
 #total = total + minsPlayed[2,3]
 #total = total + minsPlayed[2,4]
 #print(total)
#Refine the program to be more efficient. Write the refined version of the algorithm.
